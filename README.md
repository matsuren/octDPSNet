# OctDPSNet
Pytorch implementation of [Octave Deep Plane-sweeping Network: Reducing Spatial Redundancy for Learning-based Plane-sweeping Stereo]. The more detailed information is coming soon.

## Demo
You can try octDPSNet in Google Colab [here (octDPSNet_demo_colab.ipynb)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matsuren/octDPSNet/blob/master/octDPSNet_demo_colab.ipynb).

After running all cells, point cloud `results.ply` will be downloaded. You can visualize it by some tools e.g. [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/).

## Requirements

## Acknowledge
This repository is based on [sunghoonim/DPSNet](https://github.com/sunghoonim/DPSNet). Thanks a lot.
